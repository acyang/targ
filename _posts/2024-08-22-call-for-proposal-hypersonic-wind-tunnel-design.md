title: Call for Proposal - Hypersonic wind tunnel design
tags: Proposal

## Scope

Hypersonic flight plays an important role in both defense and satellite launching.  Most of the developed nations in the world have invested substantial efforts in both experimental and numerical study of hypersonic flows.  The objective of this work is to assist the design of a new hypersonic, high-enthalpy wind tunnel with operating conditions ranging from Mach 5 to 8 and atmospheric condition at 30~34 km, capable of few seconds run time.  The scope of work consists of two main tasks.  The first task is to conduct thorough survey of existing hypersonic wind tunnel in the world and provide a report to summarize the state-of-the-art and technical barriers in constructing hypersonic, high-enthalpy wind tunnel, as well as strengths and weaknesses of those surveyed wind tunnel design.  The second task is to perform numerical investigation of nozzle contour design which provides “quiet” hypersonic flow to a wind tunnel test section at the afore-mentioned operating condition.  Numerical results of a test matrix of nozzle contours and their associated degree of quietness must be assessed and reported.  The degree of quietness is defined as the turbulence level of flow entering the test section, where the goal is to have turbulence level as low as possible.  The outcome of these two tasks will provide objective help in designing and constructing a new wind tunnel to achieve realistic flight conditions.
