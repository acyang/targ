tags: Proposal

## Scope

In nowadays, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) plays a crucial role in the design and analysis of hypersonic flight systems. Hypersonic flight involves complex flow phenomena, including shock waves, boundary layers, and high-temperature gas dynamics. CFD allows engineers to model these intricate flows accurately and predict how they will affect the vehicle's performance and stability.

CFD also aids in optimizing the aerodynamic design of hypersonic vehicles. By simulating different designs and configurations, engineers can assess how changes affect drag, lift, and overall efficiency, leading to more effective and efficient designs. Developing a high-fidelity CFD code, especially for complex applications like hypersonic flight, is indeed a significant challenge. For example, like Shock Waves and Boundary Layers Interaction/High-Temperature Effects and code Stability and Convergence, etc. The UNICONES framework was developed by NCHC based on the space-time conservation element, solution element (CESE) method. It offers high accuracy, conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, and can handle complex flow phenomena with shocks and other discontinuities, vortices, acoustic waves, as well as their interactions.

This scope of work aims to cross-validate/verification various CFD solvers to provide more accurate and reliable results for designing hypersonic flights.
